# U3D-Sea
A 3D Sea made in Unity3D with **Gerstner Waves**, followed the YouTube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqCHiZrgKzs  
The Build folder contains my Sea Demo that can run by clicking the .exe file.  
The Asset folder contains a material named **M_Sea** for a plane(The sea surface) and the shadergraph named **Shader_Sea**, set M_Sea to be the material for a plane object and set the shader of M_Sea to be Shader_Sea if it's not.
